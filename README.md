# dairy-shop-academic
I have developed this project within a night in February 2019. Actually this was for one of my friend (for his academic purpose :p). I am going to open the source code so that begineer can learn from this project.

## Installation
Create a MySql database and import the database "dairy.sql"
Update your database details in ".env" file.
